UltiShaper
==========

UltiShaper started out as an application based mostly on two projects:
- CoffeeSCAD by Mark Moisette - see http://www.coffeescad.net/
- Blockly by Neil Fraser - see http://blockly.googlecode.com

Thanks to these excellent 'building blocks' the UltiShaper is a tool that:
- Design by dragging and dropping! Anyone can do it!
- Requires no CAD knowledge, you get instant feedback.
- Zero installation, it all runs in the browser. And it will be upgraded for free.
- No syntax to learn. No need to recall names, no opportunities for typo's or bugs.
- Instant sharing of either your whole project or just a little building block or shortcut.
- Powerful. With UlitShaper you cannot only design an object, you can even design a design tool and define an interface (e.g. like a slider) to modify the size of a ring.

UltiShaper allows you to design objects by dragging and dropping blocks onto a canvas. The beauty is that you can change any decision you've made without having to go back (e.g. undo) and repeat all of your steps after your change (common in almost all non-parametric design programs).

== What's in a name?
The name UltiShaper, as the "Ulti" may reveal, comes from Ultimaker. The Ultimaker is a high-performance 3D printer that is affordable. It prints fast, can make bigger objects and at an extremely high resolution!
